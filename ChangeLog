------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Name: 0.3.1
This release fixes minor issues. In particular, a monomial cannot be zero, and
iterations over monomials may be a sequence of variables.

	
Changes:
* Illegal monomial zero	forbidden and avoided.
* Exceptions are thrown for division by zero, Polynomial(0).lead(), and
  illegal ITE operation. The Python-interface handles these exceptions
  accordingly.
* Iteration over monomials as a sequence of variables is possible now. It
  is the default iterator over monomials in the python interface.
	

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Name: 0.3

Notes:
This release contains several stability improvements:  premature
conversion of constant values (bool or int) is avoided, and the correct ring
of given polynomial, monomial, variable or BooleSet is accesible. The
latter was used to improve low-level procedures, which do not depend on
the active ring any more.

In addition, python-related settings during build-process were simplified.
Also, monom1/monom2 = 0 will not result in invalid "monomial" zero.
Finally, more standard conforming rpm and deb packages are generated.
	
Changes:
* New option for scons: PYTHON=<python executable> replaces PBP and
  PYPREFIX. Python-specific paths and libraries are extracted from that
  executable. 
* Default of the PYINSTALLPREFIX option is now the site_packages directory
  of the python installation given by PYTHON.
* The tutorial can be generated using hevea or tex4ht, if latex2html is
  not available.
* PolyBoRi exceptions are now converted to python exceptions.
* Added class BooleRing for handling polynomial expressions without
  given ordering. Polynomials, monomials, Variables and BooleSet have a
  member function ring() for accessing the corresponding BooleRing
* Added class BooleConstant, which is used to avoid premature evaluation
  of bools and int values to Boolean polynomials. (Necessary if the active
  ring is changed befor using a constant value.)
* monom1/monom2 = 0 throws exception (caught and processed in python interface)
* BooleMonomial::variableBegin|End can be used to iterate over the
  variables in a given monomial.
* In python interface: iteration over monomials is a sequence of variables
  now (instead of indices).
* Also more standard conforming rpm and deb package generation.	

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Name: 0.2

Notes:
Most important changes are refined Gröbner algorithms and several
stability improvements. 
The main modifications for library users are,
that the static parts of BoolePolyRing were moved to the new class BooleEnv.
Also, new procedures for interpolation of Boolean polynomials have been
implemented. 

The pythondoc documentation was extended and several new sections of the tutorial were written.

In addition, the experimental support of rpms and debs was added. 

Changes:
* support of rpm and source-rpm generation
* support of debian packages
* some inconsistent install paths fixed
* target prepare-install for ipbori-only installations
* comparision of variables fixed
* options and attributes named more python-conform
* much more extensive tutorial
* More customizable options (see "scons -h"), which can be set using the
  config file custom.py 
  as well as via command-line settings
* Better default option settings, e.g. compilation runs with -D NDEBUG,
  linking with -s 
* "scons distribute" never builds
* The static elements from BoolePolyRing were moved to the new class BooleEnv
* C++-based core procedures should now select the correct ring internally
* Better hashes for Boolean polynomials
* Algorithmic improvements in Gröbner routines
* Interpolation of Boolean polynomials added

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Name: 0.2rc1

Many thanks to Burcin Erocal!

Changes:
