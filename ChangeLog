Release Name: 0.2

Notes:
Most important changes are refined Gröbner algorithms and several
stability improvements. 
The main modifications for library users are,
that the static parts of BoolePolyRing were moved to the new class BooleEnv.
Also, new procedures for interpolation of Boolean polynomials have been
implemented. 

The pythondoc documentation was extended and several new sections of the tutorial were written.

In addition, the experimental support of rpms and debs was added. 

Changes:
* support of rpm and source-rpm generation
* support of debian packages
* some inconsistent install paths fixed
* target prepare-install for ipbori-only installations
* comparision of variables fixed
* options and attributes named more python-conform
* much more extensive tutorial
* More customizable options (see "scons -h"), which can be set using the
  config file custom.py 
  as well as via command-line settings
* Better default option settings, e.g. compilation runs with -D NDEBUG,
  linking with -s 
* "scons distribute" never builds
* The static elements from BoolePolyRing were moved to the new class BooleEnv
* C++-based core procedures should now select the correct ring internally
* Better hashes for Boolean polynomials
* Algorithmic improvements in Gröbner routines
* Interpolation of Boolean polynomials added

Release Name: 0.1fix1

Changes:
+ Fixed memory leak while calling M4RI
+ Removed some misunderstandable statements
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Name: 0.1fix0

Notes:
This first bugfix release contains many fixes for bugs showing up during
integration into  SAGE (http://www.sagemath.org).
Also some customization of the build results from this.
Many thanks to Burcin Erocal!

Changes:
New and refined build options RELATIVE_SYMLINK, HAVE_L2H, HAVE_PYDOC,
EXTERNAL_PYTHON_EXTENSION.

New target prepare-devel, which speeds up non-development building procedure.

Fix: Binary Decision diagrams removed from PyPolyBoRi completely.

Fix: lieInSameBlock now working
Hash more unique (al least different for likewise polyomials)

Fix: [1841097] Polynomial.lexLead 

Fix: [1842334] crash in arithmetic after creating a second ring
