Description: PolyBoRi is a computer algebra system for Boolean Rings. 
  The core is a C++ library, which provides high-level data types
  for Boolean polynomials and related structures. As a unique approach, binary
  decision diagrams are used as internal storage type for polynomial
  structures. On top of this, we provide a Python interface for parsing of 
  complex polynomial systems, as well as for sophisticated and extendable
  strategies for Groebner base computation.
