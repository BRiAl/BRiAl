Installation:

Changing to the build directory (where you find this README file), and typing  

  scons install INSTALLDIR=/path/to/programs PREFIX=/prefix/for/executables

should be enough to build and install PolyBoRi to /path/to/programs/polybori/.
In addition, a symbolic link to the 'ipbori' executable will be installed to
/prefix/for/executables/bin. See /path/to/programs/polybori/doc for
documentation.

If might also be useful to add some custom setting to the file 'custom.py' in
the build directory, see the following example.

--- custom.py ---
CCFLAGS = "-g -O3  -ansi --pedantic -Wno-long-long -pg"
CXXFLAGS = "-ftemplate-depth-100"
LINKFLAGS=" -Xlinker -export-dynamic -pthread -ldl  -pg" 
LIBS=["util"]
# means that this line is not activated.
#LIBPATH = ["/custom/lib/path1", "/custom/lib/path2"]
#CPPPATH = ["/custom/include/path1", "/custom/include/path2"]
#PYPREFIX = 
#PBP = "python"
-----------------


Typing 

  scons devel-install DEVEL-PREFIX=/prefix/for/usr

generates and installs PolyBoRi headers and libraries for developers.
