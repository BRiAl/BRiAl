# This file is a wrapper which enables the use of the PolyBoRi profile for
# IPython without the need of installing the profile and setting the PolyBoRi
# directory.

# ADD: ipython functionality and wrapper
#


# First determine the directory of this script 
THIS="$0"

# Follow all symbolic links to get the real file name and directory
while [ -L ${THIS} ]; do
    THIS_DIR=`dirname "${THIS}"`
    # emulating readlink, which is not available everywhere
    ls_l=`LC_ALL=C ls -l "${THIS}" 2> /dev/null`
    THIS="${ls_l/* -> }"
    cd "${THIS_DIR}"
done
THIS_DIR=`dirname "${THIS}"`


# Assuming parent directory is PolyBoRi directory
export PBDIR=`cd "${THIS_DIR}/.."; pwd`

# Get program name
export IPBNAME=`basename $THIS`

# Get directory of ipython profile (assuming it is in same directory)
IPBDIR="${PBDIR}/ipbori"

# Calling ipython with PolyBoRi profile
#
# Note: directly calling the profile as rcfile saves us the trouble of
# installing the profile, but custom settings like IPYTHONDIR/ipythonrc are
# still available. 
# (For the latter, ipythonrc-polybori needs to import ipythonrc.)
ipython -rcfile ${IPBDIR}/ipythonrc-polybori  $@
