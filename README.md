[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BRiAl/BRiAl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BRiAl/BRiAl)

BRiAl is the legacy version of PolyBoRi maintained by sagemath developers.

libBRiAl is the C/C++ library part of BRiAl.

The building requisite for libBRiAl are
* A modern C compiler supporting the C99 standard
* A modern C++ compiler supporting at least the C++98 standard and preferably the C++11
* A recent Boost release
* Optionally (but highly recommended) the m4ri library

Also included but to be installed separately is sage-brial.
sage-brial offers a python interface to libbrial through the
sage bindings to libbrial.
